        <section>
            <p>Amsterdam is an excellent starting point for exploring other places in the Netherlands. In 2026 this remains true, but there are important changes: beyond the increase in tourist taxes in the capital, some adjacent attractions now have access control. Therefore, planning your day trip well — considering crowds, travel time and 2026 rules — is the secret to an incredible day.</p>
            <p>This guide summarizes classic destinations, explains how to get there (approximate door-to-door time), points out what changed in 2026 and presents strategies to escape the crowds. Information comes exclusively from official sources — tourism portals of the Amsterdam municipality, provincial government or the attractions themselves.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How to choose the ideal day trip</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Think about time and travel profile.</strong> From Amsterdam center you reach nearby destinations in 15–40 minutes by train or bus, while more remote places may require 2 hours or more.</li>
                <li><strong>For those with only one free day</strong> or visiting the Netherlands for the first time, cities like Haarlem and Utrecht deliver a lot of return with little travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the season.</strong> Keukenhof, for example, is only open from March 19 to May 10, 2026; outside this period the gardens are closed.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider crowds and experience.</strong> Classic locations attract tour groups and can get saturated mid-day. Eating lunch off-peak or taking a break in a park completely changes the perception.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <h3>🏭 Zaanse Schans — Windmills and Historic Village</h3>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> 17 min train + 15 min walk</p>
                <p>Train from Central Station to Zaandijk – Zaanse Schans in approx. 17 minutes, followed by a 15-minute walk to the windmill village. Alternative: get off at Zaandam (12 min) and take bus or taxi.</p>
                
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>2026 Change:</strong> Zaanstad municipality approved access control. Entry to public areas costs <strong>€17.50</strong> for adults. Residents of Zaanstad and Wormerland enter free.
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Anti-crowd strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visit early (before 10am) or late afternoon to avoid tour groups</li>
                    <li>Buy tickets in advance online, especially on sunny weekends</li>
                    <li>For photos and walking, two hours suffice; for museums and windmills, reserve half a day</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>🌷 Keukenhof — Seasonal Tulips</h3>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> ~1h door to door (bus 852 from RAI)</p>
                <p>The Keukenhof Express (bus 852) departs from Amsterdam RAI station and takes about 35 minutes to the park entrance. Including travel from the center to RAI, calculate about 1 hour door to door.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>2026 Season:</strong> The park is open <strong>March 19 to May 10, 2026</strong>, daily 08:00 to 19:00 (entry until 18:15). Tickets have fixed date and time.
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Practical tips:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visit on weekdays, preferably at opening</li>
                    <li>Weekends between April and early May fill up quickly</li>
                    <li>Buy tickets and combi-ticket (transport + entry) in advance — pre-sale in February</li>
                    <li>Operates cashless (no cash payments)</li>
                    <li>Parking €9 bought online</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>🚣 Giethoorn — Venice of the Netherlands (with caveats)</h3>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2 to 2.5h by train (~€25/person)</p>
                <p>By train, the Amsterdam → Giethoorn journey takes 2 to 2.5 hours, including transfers at Zwolle station and regional line. By car: 1h25. By tour bus: ~1h40.</p>
                <p><strong>Honest reality:</strong> Giethoorn is beautiful, but the travel consumes the day. In summer and holidays, the canals get congested with visitor boats. If you have little time in the Netherlands, consider closer destinations (Utrecht or Haarlem), which also offer charming canals and architecture without complicated logistics.</p>

                    <span class="badge badge-green">Recommended</span>
                    <h3>🏛️ Haarlem — The Best Neighbor</h3>
                    <p><strong>~20 min by train</strong></p>
                    <p>Haarlem is considered a "mini-Amsterdam": canals, 17th-century architecture and good cultural scene, with fewer tourists. The Grote Markt is perfect to explore on foot. Use half a day to see the historic center and visit a museum (like Frans Hals) or the local Jopenkerk brewery.</p>
                    <p><strong>Combine with:</strong> Zuid-Kennemerland (dune park) or Zandvoort beach — both just minutes by train.</p>

                    <span class="badge badge-green">Recommended</span>
                    <h3>🎓 Utrecht — Unique Canals and Young Vibe</h3>
                    <p><strong>~25 min Intercity train</strong></p>
                    <p>Utrecht combines a university vibe with canals different from Amsterdam: the banks are lower and full of cafés. Ideal for walking without a route, visiting the Domtoren (cathedral tower) or the Speelklok music museum. Reserve a day to explore museums; half a day just to walk and have lunch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>🏙️ Rotterdam — The Modern Anti-Amsterdam</h3>
                    <p><strong>~40 min by train</strong> (25-30 min from Amsterdam Zuid with Intercity Direct)</p>
                    <p>Rotterdam impresses precisely for being the opposite of Amsterdam: vertical skyline, futuristic architecture (cube houses, Markthal), ports and design museums. Ideal for those who like modern architecture or want to see contemporary Netherlands.</p>
                    <p><strong>Combine:</strong> Morning in Delft, afternoon in Rotterdam.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>🏺 Delft — Blue Ceramics and Historic Charm</h3>
                    <p><strong>~1h by train</strong></p>
                    <p>Small and photogenic, Delft is the birthplace of blue ceramics (Delftware) and Vermeer. The historic center is compact, with a beautiful market and narrow canals. In 2026, a great destination for a peaceful day or to combine with The Hague (Mauritshuis and Binnenhof).</p>

            <h2>Day trips by bike or public transport</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>🚴 Marken and Waterland — Rural, Close and Quiet</h3>
                <p>From Amsterdam Noord (after crossing the free GVB ferry), take bus 315 or 316 to Marken (~30 minutes). Alternatively, use the bike path: the Waterland region is flat and allows self-guided bike routes.</p>
                <p>Nearby villages like Volendam and Edam are ~30 minutes by bus; Monnickendam and Purmerend 15 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Why go:</strong> These villages preserve colorful wooden houses and dikes, offering a bucolic Netherlands without mass excursions. Ideal for a bike day trip (bring a rain jacket!) or to try fresh seafood.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>🏰 Muiden & Muiderslot — A Real Castle</h3>
                <p>Take the train from Amsterdam Centraal or Utrecht Centraal to Weesp, then bus 110 to Muiden Centrum; from the stop it's 10 minutes walk to the castle. Total time from Amsterdam center to Muiderslot is approx. 45 minutes.</p>
                <p>Muiderslot castle dates from the 13th century and is maintained as part of the Rijksmuseum. An excellent half-day trip for those who like medieval history.</p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check opening hours and book tickets online.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>🦅 Almere & Lelystad (New Land)</h3>
                <p>Train from Amsterdam Centraal to Almere Centrum in 20 minutes; from Almere to Lelystad Centrum in another 14 minutes. For Nieuw Land national park, get off at Almere Oostvaarders and walk about 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>The cities of Almere and Lelystad are examples of recent engineering on land reclaimed from the sea. The area features modern architecture and Nieuw Land park, great for bird watching. Not a "classic" destination, but appeals to those looking for something different.</p>

            <h2>General tips for stress-free day trips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prefer weekdays.</strong> Weekend excursions increase queue time and number of people.</li>
                <li><strong>Start early.</strong> Leaving before 09:00 guarantees emptier cities and attractions.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan by useful time.</strong> Destinations requiring more than 1.5h travel each way consume most of the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Check payment and reservations.</strong> Many places in 2026 are cashless and require online tickets (Zaanse Schans, Keukenhof, museums). Have a contactless card ready and download transport apps.</li>
                <li><strong>Check weather forecast.</strong> The Netherlands is famous for unexpected wind and rain. Bring a waterproof jacket.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>What's the best day trip for those short on time?</h3>
                <p>Haarlem or Utrecht are excellent: trains take about 20–25 minutes and you can enjoy the whole day.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Is Keukenhof worth it?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but only during the official season (March 19 to May 10, 2026). Go on a weekday and buy tickets online.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Has Zaanse Schans become a tourist trap?</h3>
                <p>It still delivers for the landscape, but in 2026 you'll need to pay €17.50 entry. Plan your timing and know there will be access control.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Is Giethoorn worth the travel?</h3>
                <p>Only if you have days to spare or want a romantic outing. The train journey takes up to 2.5 hours, and canals can get congested in summer.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Can I combine two destinations in one day?</h3>
                <p>Yes: Delft + Rotterdam, Haarlem + Zandvoort beach, Zaanse Schans + Alkmaar (cheese). Check train schedules.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Do I need to book in advance?</h3>
                <p>For Zaanse Schans, Keukenhof, museums like Rijksmuseum and Anne Frank House: yes. For Haarlem, Utrecht or Waterland: no, just go.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>What's the best time for each destination?</h3>
                <p>Spring for Keukenhof; summer for Marken and Waterland (long days and pleasant weather); autumn for Utrecht and Haarlem (fewer tourists). Zaanse Schans and castles work year-round, but avoid heavy rain days.</p>
